# VGA Blinken with Onboard Connector
Modified version of the VGA Blinken PBC by Danjovic:<br>

This version of the PCB has SMD passives to save space, but adds an onboard DB-15 connector for easy connection to a monitor. The PIC microcontroller is still DIP and socketed to allow for external programming.

See the original project page for the parts values, firmware, etc. The passives are 0603. The DB-15 footprint is for a standard through-hole, right angle connector (Amphenol FCI ICD15S13E6GV00LF or similar).<br>

It’s no longer 1" square, but it’s a lot easier to hook up that monitor with the onboard connector!<br>
